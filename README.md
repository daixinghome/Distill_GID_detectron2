# Distill_GID_detectron2
Paper Link: [General Instance Distillation for Object Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Dai_General_Instance_Distillation_for_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf)  

This code is a reproduce version on detectron2, for the original version is realized in a private internal training framework.  
Due to some internal equipment resource reasons, we are temporarily unable to continue the accuracy alignment work. However, many researchers contact us for implementation details, so we decide to share the code in advance. We hope people can know more about our method and get more inspiration.  

And we will release the final code in the future. After AAAI :)
