    For each feature map, select the `pre_nms_topk` highest scoring proposals,
    apply NMS, clip proposals, and remove small boxes. Return the `post_nms_topk`
    highest scoring proposals among all the feature maps for each image.
    Args:
        proposals (list[Tensor]): A list of L tensors. Tensor i has shape (N, Hi*Wi*A, 4).
            All proposal predictions on the feature maps.
        pred_objectness_logits (list[Tensor]): A list of L tensors. Tensor i has shape (N, Hi*Wi*A).
        gt_labels (List[torch.Tensor]): Label assign result. Tensor i has shape (N, Hi*Wi*A).
        image_sizes (list[tuple]): sizes (h, w) for each image
        nms_thresh (float): IoU threshold to use for NMS
        pre_nms_topk (int): number of top k scoring proposals to keep before applying NMS.
            When RPN is run on multiple feature maps (as in FPN) this number is per
            feature map.
        post_nms_topk (int): number of top k scoring proposals to keep after applying NMS.
            When RPN is run on multiple feature maps (as in FPN) this number is total,
            over all feature maps.
        min_box_size (float): minimum proposal box side length in pixels (absolute units
            wrt input images).
        training (bool): True if proposals are to be used in training, otherwise False.
            This arg exists only to support a legacy bug; look for the "NB: Legacy bug ..."
            comment.
    Returns:
        list[Instances]: list of N Instances. The i-th Instances
            stores post_nms_topk object proposals for image i, sorted by their
            objectness score in descending order.
